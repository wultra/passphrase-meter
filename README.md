# Wultra Passphrase Meter

Wultra Passphrase Meter is a multi-platform library implementing offline passphrase strength validation. The validation code itself is based on a slightly modified version of [zxcvbn-c](https://github.com/tsyrogit/zxcvbn-c). Choosing a weak passphrase in applications with high-security demands can be potentially dangerous. The primary purpose of this library is to **warn the user** when he tries to use such passphrase in your mobile application.
