# Passphrase Meter for Android Apps

## Installation 

To get Wultra Passphrase Meter for Android up and running in your app, add following dependency in your `gradle.build` file:

```groovy
repositories {
    mavenCentral() // if not defined elsewhere...
}

dependencies {
    implementation "com.wultra.android.passphrasemeter:passphrasemeter-core:1.1.0"
}
```
Note that this documentation is using version `1.0.0` as an example. You can find the latest version in our [List of Releases](https://github.com/wultra/passphrase-meter/releases). The Android Studio IDE can also find and offer updates for your application's dependencies.

To achieve more accurate password testing results, you can add a dependency to additional dictionaries, designed for particular regions:

| Additional dependency | Region or Language |
|----------------|--------------------|
| `implementation "com.wultra.android.passphrasemeter:passphrasemeter-dictionary-en:1.1.0"`   | For English speaking people |
| `implementation "com.wultra.android.passphrasemeter:passphrasemeter-dictionary-czsk:1.1.0"` | For people speaking in Czech or Slovak |
| `implementation "com.wultra.android.passphrasemeter:passphrasemeter-dictionary-ro:1.1.0"` | For Romanian speaking people |


## Usage

Before you start using the library, you need to add several imports into your Kotlin source codes:

```kotlin
import com.wultra.android.passphrasemeter.*
import com.wultra.android.passphrasemeter.exceptions.*
```

### Password testing

In order to test the password strength, use following code:

```kotlin
// If your app has an additional dependency on english dictionary,  
// then you need to load that dictionary first.
PasswordTester.getInstance().loadDictionary(assets, "en.dct")
// Test the password
val result = PasswordTester.getInstance().testPassword("test")
```

You can evaluate any password. The result of such operation is a strength of the password with the following levels:

- **Very Weak**
- **Weak**
- **Moderate**
- **Good**
- **Strong**

The password testing takes several things into account (keyboard patterns, alphabetical order, repetition, etc...). You can also add a dictionary of well-known words to get rid of passwords that looks strong to algorithms but are actually very common spoken words, or very frequent passwords.

### Additional dictionaries

The password strength testing can be improved by loading an appropriate dictionary. Due to limitations in the underlying `zxcvbn-c` implementation, only one dictionary can be loaded in the memory at the same time. Fortunately, this technical limitation typically doesn't cause problems in real-world scenarios, because people typically speak in one primary language. So, we decided to prefer fewer changes in the low level "zxcvbn-c" implementation, over more developer-friendly API.

We recommend you to use dictionaries in the following manners:

1. Determine in which language your user speak
1. Load an appropriate dictionary with using `.loadDictionary()` function
1. Use the password testing functions
1. Release previously loaded resources:
   ```kotlin
   PasswordTester.getInstance().freeLoadedDictionary()
   ```

If you do not free the loaded dictionary, then the allocated resources will be released in the next `.loadDictionary()` call.


### PIN testing

The PIN testing is slightly different to password testing, because the result of such test is a list of findings. Look for this example:

```kotlin
try {
    val passcode = "1456"
    val result = PasswordTester.getInstance().testPin(passcode)
    if (result.issues.isEmpty()) {
        // No issues were found. 
    }
    
    if (result.result.shouldWarnUserAboutWeakPin()) {
    	// Warn the user that the PIN is weak.
		// Be aware that this property is just a hint based on simple rules. 
		// Consider implementing your own logic based on the `issues` property.
    }
} catch (e: WrongPinException) {
    // PIN format error
}
```

You can evaluate any PIN. The result of the testing is a collection of issues that were found in PIN. This issues can be:

- **Not Unique** - the passcode doesn't have enough unique digits.
- **Repeating Digits** - there is a significant amount of repeating digits in the passcode.
- **Has Pattern** - repeating pattern was found in the passcode - 1357 for example.
- **Possibly Date** - this passcode can be a date and possibly birthday of the user.
- **Frequently Used** - the passcode is in list of most used passcodes.
- **Wrong Input** - wrong input - the passcode must contain digits only.

### Example project

The repository contains a simple example application, showing usage of the library:

1. Import `Source/examples/Android/PassMeterExample` folder in Android Studio
1. Build and run an example application

If everything works fine, then you can test your passwords in the simulator (or on a real device):
